# Udemy-Python-Mega-Course
Repository of Applications built refer to Udemy Couse: Python Mega Course by Ardit Suice

All applications are recreated by me. So they may be different than developing in the course

There will be 10 applications that we will build together. These are:
* English Thesaurus - a program where users can get definitions of words.
* Volcano Web Map - an interactive web map of volcano locations throughout the USA.
* Personal Website with Python - a live website built entirely in Python.
* Bookshop Database App - a desktop GUI app with an SQL database backend.
* Feel Good Mobile App - an Android & iOS app.
* Webcam Motion Detector - starts the webcam and detects moving objects.
* Real Estate Web Scraper - a program that extracts data from webpages.
* Interactive Data Dashboard - a web-based, fully interactive graph.
* Database Web App - a web app that collects data & sends emails.
* Geocoder Web App - a web app that converts addresses to coordinates.
